One question is why do “superseding” patches have a CVSS Severity of NA and Severity of NA?

Surely the Superseded patches should have that and the new patches should have the correct severity levels?

It depends on when the superseding Updates were released. 

The cumulative updates that are released on Patch Tuesday typically have a Microsoft Severity and CVSS severity of Critical but when a cumulative update is 
published outside of Patch Tuesday, it has no vulnerability rating.
